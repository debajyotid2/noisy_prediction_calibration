# Noisy Prediction Calibration (2022)

This repository contains implementation of the source code for the paper (Bae,
HeeSun, et al. "From noisy prediction to true label: Noisy prediction
calibration via generative model." International Conference on Machine
Learning. PMLR, 2022.) in Tensorflow 2. The original PyTorch implementation can
be found at https://github.com/BaeHeeSun/NPC/tree/main.
